  <p><em><strong><h3>Moussaka is an eggplant- or potato-based dish, often including ground meat, which is common in the Balkans and the Middle East, with many local and regional variations.

    The modern Greek variant was created in the 1920s by Nikolaos Tselementes.[citation needed] Many versions have a top layer made of milk-based sauce thickened with egg (custard) or flour (béchamel sauce). In Greece, the dish is layered and typically served hot. Tselementes also proposed a vegan variant for orthodox fast days. Romania also has a vegan version that replaces meat with mushrooms or a mix of sautéed onions and rice.
    
    The versions in Egypt, Turkey and the rest of the Middle East are quite different. In Egypt, messa'aa can be made vegan or vegetarian as well as with meat; in all cases, the main ingredient is the fried eggplant. In Turkey, mussaka consists of thinly sliced and fried eggplant served in a tomato-based meat sauce, warm or at room temperature. In Saudi Arabia muṣagga is eaten hot, but in other Arab countries, it is often eaten cold, but occasionally hot as well.</h3></strong></em></p>

    <h3>Steps
      <ol><h3>
        <li>Lay eggplant slices on paper towels; sprinkle lightly with salt. Let sit for 30 minutes to draw out moisture, then pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Warm olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Fry eggplant until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels; set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in ground beef, onions, and garlic; season with salt and black pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add parsley, fines herbs, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Pour in tomato sauce and wine; mix well. Simmer for 20 minutes. Allow to cool, then stir in beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Scald milk in a saucepan over medium heat</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour into butter until smooth. Lower heat; gradually pour in scalded milk, whisking constantly until it thickens. Season béchamel sauce with salt and white pepper</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish</li>
        <li>Arrange a single layer of eggplant in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cover eggplant with meat sauce, then sprinkle 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese on top. Cover with remaining eggplant and sprinkle another 1/2 cup cheese on top</li>
        <li>Pour béchamel sauce on top and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Cover with remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and browned, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
